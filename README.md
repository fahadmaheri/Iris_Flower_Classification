# Iris Flower Classification

This project demonstrates a basic classification model to predict the species of an Iris flower using features like sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The model achieves 100% accuracy on a test dataset.

## Key Features:
- Data analysis using pandas and seaborn
- Heatmap to show feature correlation
- Machine learning with scikit-learn (K-Nearest Neighbors)
- Evaluation with accuracy score and classification report

## How to Run:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required libraries: `pandas`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`.
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to train and evaluate the model.
